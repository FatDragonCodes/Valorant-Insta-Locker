# Fat Dragon Valorant InstaLocker
Simple program created using image recognition to detect when we are selecting an agent and lock a agent using user defined coordinates. This program is designed to work using user key inputs rather than using the console itself.

# Disclaimer ⚠️
I am in no way a professional coder, i do this in my free time for a challange. Im entirely self taught, any feedback and or improvemnts are greatly appriciated. This script was designed for personal usage, but a few frends recommended i share it. This script controls your mouse movement, meaning it should not result in a Anti-Cheat ban - with this in mind please use this at your own risk. 

# Defualt Binds ⌨️ 
U: Allows user to load, delete and save configs. Prompts will appear on the console with steps.

O: Sets Agent coord locations
P: Sets confirm button locations
M: Enables/Disables the instalock script

# Setup ⚙️
[1] First lets make sure valorant is running in windowed fulled screen mode (this is required to allow us to search for images on screen)
[2] Load a private game so we can setup coords
[3] Make sure the coords are unlocked using the I toggle key.
[4] Hover the agent you wish to instalock and press O. Once confirmed press I again to relock coords to prevent accidental changes
[5] Now press U to begin saving config
[6] Type save and press enter
[7] Now enter the config name, your config should now have saved.
[8] You can load this by pressing U, then typing load,  followed by the config name.
