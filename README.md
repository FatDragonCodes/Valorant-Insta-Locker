# Fat Dragon Valorant InstaLocker üêâ
Simple program created using image recognition to detect when we are selecting an agent and lock a agent using user defined coordinates. 

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
I am in no way a professional coder, i do this in my free time for a challange. Im entirely self taught, any feedback and or improvemnts are greatly appriciated. This script was designed for personal usage, but a few frends recommended i share it. This script controls your mouse movement, meaning it should not result in a Anti-Cheat ban - with this in mind please use this at your own risk.

# Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

[4] Hover the agent you wish to instalock and press O. Once confirmed press I again to relock coords to prevent accidental changes\
[5] Now press U to begin saving config\
[6] Type save and press enter\
[7] Now enter the config name, your config should now have saved.\
[8] You can load this by pressing U, then typing load,  followed by the config name.\

# FAQ üìô
Will This Get Me Banned?
- No, this controls the users mouse input and doesnt interfere with any game memory/integrity.
Can I Change Keybinds?
- Currently there is no way to edit this using the program itself. Although you are able to manually update this by changing the appropriate values in the agents.json file 
Why does the program require admin esc?
- We require admin esc to ensure we can block user mouse inputs whilst attempting to insta lock, this prevents user error causing miss clicks.
